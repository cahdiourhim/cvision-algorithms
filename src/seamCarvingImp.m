% SeamCarving.m
% Implementation of the Seam Carving algorithm for content-aware image resizing.
% This script defines the main functions required to calculate energy maps, 
% identify low-energy seams, and resize images by removing or inserting seams.
% Based on the paper: "Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing" by S. Avidan & A. Shamir, 2007.

% [INSERT EXISTING CODE HERE]
% Example enhancements with comments:

% Calculate energy map
% This step computes the importance of each pixel in the image.
energyMap = computeEnergy(image);

% Find the optimal seam
% The seam is identified using a dynamic programming approach.
optimalSeam = findOptimalSeam(energyMap);

% Remove the seam
% The identified low-energy seam is removed to resize the image.
resizedImage = removeSeam(image, optimalSeam);
